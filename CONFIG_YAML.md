# Config file in YAML format

Because the mqtt-s7 module was intended to be used in Home Assistant,
and these days YAML is the standard for configuring 
everything, I decided to add support for YAML.
Besides, YAML is easier to write and read.

If you want to use YAML as your configuration, you will need to add `--yaml` to your start command 
e.g. `$ npm start -- --yaml`. Please refer the [commandline options](README.md#commandline-options) section for more information

This document is changed to match the YAML config format

## Config File

The configuration file has to be located in the same directory as the installation and has to be named `config.yaml`

__An example of a correct configuration file is found in [```config.example.yaml```](config.example.yaml).__

The **yaml** config file has to be valid YAML (You can check [here](https://www.yamllint.com/) if it's correct),  
and it is separated in three sections:

- [`plc:`](#plc-object)
- [`mqtt:`](#mqtt-object)
- [`devices:`](#devices-object)

### `plc` Object
_General setup of the connection to the plc_

In most use cases, you only have to change the host value to the correct ip
```yaml
plc:
  port: 102
  host: 192.168.0.1
  rack: 0
  slot: 2
  debug: false
```

### `mqtt` Object
_general setup of the connection to the mqtt broker_

The URL/host value can be one of the following protocols: 'mqtt', 'mqtts', 'tcp', 'tls', 'ws', 'wss'.

If you are using a self-signed certificate, use the ```rejectUnauthorized: false``` option. Beware that you are exposing yourself to man in the middle attacks, so it is a configuration that is not recommended for production environments.
[More info](https://github.com/mqttjs/MQTT.js#mqttconnecturl-options)

```yaml
mqtt:
    host: mqtts://host.com:1234
    user: u
    password: p
    rejectUnauthorized: true
```

### `devices` Object
_list of all registered devices__

the list of devices is implemented as an array in YAML.  
each device has its own entry in this list and will be configured there.

Each device has to have a 'name' entry and a 'type' entry, the remaining attributes are optional
```yaml
devices:
  - name: Dimmable Light,
    type: light,
    state: DB56,X150.0,
    brightness: DB56,BYTE151
  - name: Dimmable Light 2,
    type: light,
    state: DB56,X150.1,
```

## Address formatting
This tool uses the NodeS7 Library, and it uses the same address formatting.  
An example of correct formatted addresses is found at the [NodeS7 Repository](https://github.com/plcpeople/nodeS7#examples)

__Address examples:__  
DB56,X150.0 _(read from DB56 one bit at 150.0)_  
DB51,REAL216 _(read from DB51 four bytes starting from byte 216)_  
DB56,BYTE40 _(read from DB56 one byte at 40)_

__Supported data types__  
X = 1 Bit → converted to true / false  
BYTE = 1 Byte (8 Bit) → converted to Int  
REAL = 4 Bytes (32 Bit) → converted to Float

For more information, see the [NodeS7 Repository](https://github.com/plcpeople/nodeS7#examples)

## Device types and attributes
The device type categories are based on the categories from Home Assistant  
__It is strongly recommended to look into the [example configuration file](https://github.com/timroemisch/mqtt-s7-connector/blob/master/config.example.json) !!__

Current list of supported device types with supported attributes:

* light
    * `state` _(X)_  
      on/off state of the device

    * `brightness` _(BYTE)_  
      value between 0-255


* sensor
    * `state` _(X/BYTE/REAL)_  
      state of a device  
      _is readonly by default_


* switch
    * `state` _(X)_  
      on/off state of the device


* climate
    * `target_temperature` _(REAL)_

    * `current_temperature` _(REAL)_  
      _readonly by default_  
      _update_interval is 15 min by default_


* cover
    * `targetPosition` _(BYTE)_

    * `tiltAngle` _(BYTE)_

    * `currentPosition` _(BYTE)_  
      _readonly by default_

    * `currentTiltAngle` _(BYTE)_  
      _readonly by default_

    * `trigger` _(X)_  
      __internal value__: it won't be exposed over mqtt  
      this bit will be turned on and off automatically after one of the other attributes of the cover is changed


* binaryCover
    * `targetPosition` _(X)_

    * `currentPosition` _(X)_  
      _readonly by default_


## Attribute Options

A "simple" device has just the plc address as the value of the attributes;  
however, it's possible to configure each attribute individually by assigning an object instead of a string to it.


Simple Attribute:
```yaml
state: DB56,X150.0
```

Rewritten Attribute:
```yaml
state: 
    plc: DB56,X150.0
```

Now after rewriting, it's possible to add more options inside the brackets of the attribute.

__Available options:__

### `rw` option
Changes the read / write permissions

|    | Read PLC | Write PLC | Subscribe MQTT | Publish MQTT |
|----|----------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| r  | ✅        | ❌         | ❌              | ✅            |
| w  | ❌        | ✅         | ✅              | ❌            |
| rw | ✅        | ✅         | ✅              | ✅            |

```yaml
state:
    plc: DB56,X150.0,
    rw: r
```

### `update_interval` option
By default, (without this option) each attribute will send an update over mqtt after it changes, but this option will disable it and set an interval for updates.  
The time is set in ms
```yaml
state:
    plc: DB56,BYTE234,
    update_interval: 1000
```

### `unit_of_measurement` option
This is only for Home Assistant. It will add an extra unit of measurement to the data.
```yaml
state:
    plc: DB56,REAL10,
    unit_of_measurement: km/h
```

### `set_plc` option
By default, attributes have only one address, but if you define "set_plc"  
the attribute will read from "plc" and write to "set_plc"
```yaml
state:
    plc: DB56,X150.0,
    set_plc: DB56,X150.1
```

### `write_back` option
When using both `plc_address` and `plc_set_address`, setting `write_back` to `true`
will automatically write any changes read from `plc_address` to `plc_set_address`.
```yaml
state:
    plc: DB56,X150.0,
    set_plc: DB56,X150.1,
    write_back: true
```
